# **Healthcare Data Analysis Dashboard**  

## **Overview**  
This project analyzes a healthcare dataset to uncover insights related to **height, weight, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking habits, and correlations between them**. The dataset was sourced from [this repository](https://github.com/MohammedKhan68/Data_Analysis_Healthcare_data), and **SQL** was used to extract relevant tables for analysis.  

A **data model** was created, and a **dashboard** was developed to visualize and interpret key insights.

## **Insights Explored**  

### **Descriptive Statistics & Distributions**  
- **What is the average height and weight for males and females?**  
- **What is the distribution of cholesterol levels across different age groups?**  
- **What percentage of people in the dataset are smokers?**  
- **What are the minimum, maximum, and average blood pressure values (`ap_hi` and `ap_low`)?**  

### **Comparisons & Correlations**  
- **Do smokers tend to have higher cholesterol levels compared to non-smokers?**  
- **Is there a significant difference in average blood pressure between males and females?**  
- **How does BMI (Body Mass Index) differ between males and females?**  
  *(BMI = weight / (height/100)^2)*  
- **Does age have a correlation with cholesterol levels?**  

### **Hypothesis Testing & Trends**  
- **Do males have a higher smoking rate than females?**  
- **Does high cholesterol (level 3) correlate with high blood pressure?**  
- **Are older individuals (above 50) more likely to have high blood pressure than younger ones?**  
- **Are smokers more likely to have high blood pressure than non-smokers?**

## **Workflow**  

1. **Data Extraction & Cleaning**  
   - Extracted relevant data using **SQL queries**.  
   - Cleaned and structured the dataset for efficient analysis.  

2. **Data Modeling**  
   - Created a **data model** from the extracted tables for better relationships and structured insights.  

3. **Dashboard Development**  
   - Designed an **interactive dashboard** to visualize and explore the findings.

## **Technologies Used**  
- **SQL** – For data extraction and transformation  
- **Power BI** – For visualization and analysis  
- **Excel** – For data preprocessing
